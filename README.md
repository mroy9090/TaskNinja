# TaskNinja
## Overview

This project is a Django-based web application designed to provide a centralized platform for managing and monitoring various network devices. It allows users to:
✅ Configure settings
✅ Analyze network data
✅ Interact with devices seamlessly through an intuitive dashboard.

## Features

🔍 Real-time Device Monitoring: Track the status and performance of connected devices.

⚙️ Configuration Management: Easily update settings and firmware.

📊 Centralized Dashboard: Access all essential network information from one interface.

🔒 Security Measures: Implements authentication and role-based access control.

🤖 Automated Network Configuration: Uses YAML-based configurations to manage network settings.

🌍 Multi-Vendor Device Support: Uses Ansible to interact with devices from different network vendors.

## Configuration Management

📜 ipaddress.yml: Stores network device configurations and credentials.

⚡ yml.py: Parses YAML files and applies settings using Ansible.

🛠️ Django Admin Panel: Available at /admin for managing users and settings.

🤖 Ansible Integration for Multi-Vendor Network Devices

## This project leverages Ansible to automate network device configurations across different vendors. The automation process includes:

🌍 Device Connectivity: Uses Ansible modules to establish SSH connections to routers, switches, and firewalls.

🔄 Configuration Deployment: Applies YAML-based configurations to update device settings.

🏢 Vendor-Agnostic Approach: Works with Cisco, Juniper, Arista, and other network devices.

🚀 Playbook Execution: Run Ansible playbooks to configure multiple devices simultaneously.

## Usage

🔑 Login as Admin: Access the admin panel at /admin to manage users and settings.

🌐 Device Management: View, add, or modify network devices via the dashboard.

⚙️ Automated Configuration: Run yml.py to process YAML configurations:

python yml.py

🚀 Execute Ansible Playbooks: Use Ansible to push configurations to multiple devices.
